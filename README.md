# THREAT ALERT

### Iteration 1:
- **Sign up**
- **Login**
- **Logout**
- **Scan function** - Working on localhost but not on Render due to API's restrictions. Hence, the scan button is commented out. We are changing our API to make it work on Render for the next iterations.

Please refer to the demo video in the submission for the scan URL feature.

### Iteration 2:
- **Sign up**
- **Login**
- **Logout**
- **Scan function** - changed to Link Preview API - ApyHub instead of VirusTotal API
- **Personalized History**
- **Test cases for all features**
